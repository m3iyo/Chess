# How to Play Chess: Basic Rules

Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in "check") and there is no way for it to escape.

## Setup

1.  The board is set up so that each player has a light-colored square on their bottom-right corner.
2.  The pieces are arranged on the two ranks closest to each player:
    *   **Back Rank (closest to player):** Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight, Rook. The Queen is placed on the square of her own color (White Queen on a light square, Black Queen on a dark square).
    *   **Front Rank:** All 8 Pawns.
3.  White always moves first.

## Piece Movements

Each type of piece moves differently:

*   **King (K):** Can move one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The King is the most important piece; losing it means losing the game. The King also has a special move called "castling."
*   **Queen (Q):** Can move any number of unoccupied squares in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It's the most powerful piece.
*   **Rook (R):** Can move any number of unoccupied squares horizontally or vertically. Rooks are also involved in castling.
*   **Bishop (B):** Can move any number of unoccupied squares diagonally. Each player starts with two bishops, one on light squares and one on dark squares; they always stay on squares of their starting color.
*   **Knight (N):** Moves in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction (horizontal or vertical) and then one square perpendicular to that. The Knight is the only piece that can jump over other pieces.
*   **Pawn (P):**
    *   Pawns move forward one square at a time.
    *   On their first move, a pawn has the option to move forward one or two squares.
    *   Pawns capture diagonally one square forward.
    *   **Promotion:** If a pawn reaches the opponent's back rank (the farthest row from its starting position), it must be promoted to another piece (Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight) of the same color. Usually, it's promoted to a Queen.
    *   **En Passant ("in passing"):** A special pawn capture. If a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands next to an opponent's pawn (on the same rank, in an adjacent file), the opponent's pawn has the option to capture the first pawn as if it had only moved one square forward. This en passant capture must be made on the very next turn, or the right to do so is lost.

## Basic Concepts

*   **Check:** When a King is under attack by an opponent's piece, it is in "check." The player whose King is in check must make a move that gets the King out of check. This can be done by:
    1.  Moving the King to a square that is not attacked.
    2.  Blocking the check by placing another piece between the King and the attacking piece (not possible if attacked by a Knight).
    3.  Capturing the attacking piece.
*   **Checkmate:** If a King is in check and there is no legal move to get the King out of check, it is "checkmate," and the player whose King is checkmated loses the game.
*   **Stalemate:** If a player whose turn it is to move has no legal moves, but their King is *not* in check, the game is a "stalemate" and results in a draw.
*   **Draw:** Besides stalemate, a game can be drawn in several other ways, including agreement between players, threefold repetition of a position, or the fifty-move rule (if 50 moves are made by each player without a pawn move or a capture).

## Special Moves

*   **Castling:** A special move involving the King and one of the Rooks of the same color. It allows a player to move the King two squares towards a Rook and then place the Rook on the square the King crossed over. Conditions for castling:
    1.  Neither the King nor the chosen Rook has previously moved.
    2.  There are no pieces between the King and the chosen Rook.
    3.  The King is not currently in check.
    4.  The King does not pass through or land on any square that is attacked by an opponent's piece.
    *   **Kingside Castling (O-O):** With the Rook on the King's side.
    *   **Queenside Castling (O-O-O):** With the Rook on the Queen's side (the King moves two squares, and the Rook moves three).

This covers the very basics to get you started! Enjoy the game.
